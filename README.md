# MNIST_DrawAndClassify_01
 KIVY-Keras interactive MNIST classifier

This UI allows testing of three pre-trained CNN that classify 28x28 grey scale hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 from the classic MNIST dataset.

Draw a number - save it and then classify and analyse it.

Switch CNN using the Network buttons.

Works on touch screen eg MS Surface Pro well.
